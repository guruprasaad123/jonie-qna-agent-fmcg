"""
Conversation memory: multi-turn history + extracted "active filters" (the
entities/dimensions/period currently in focus) + rolling summarization.

Design rationale (docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md has the full writeup):
  - Two complementary representations are kept, not one:
      1. `active_filters` -- a small structured dict (brand, country, channel,
         kpi, period, ...) updated after every turn. This is what actually
         answers "Support contextual follow-up questions" and "Support
         conversation context preservation" cheaply and reliably: a
         follow-up like "what about last year?" is resolved by reusing
         active_filters rather than re-parsing the whole transcript.
      2. `raw_turns` -- the literal recent exchange, kept verbatim for a
         bounded window (RECENT_TURNS_KEPT) so the model sees exact wording.
  - "Support conversation memory optimization for long-running sessions" is
    implemented as rolling summarization: once history exceeds a threshold,
    older turns are compressed into `rolling_summary` (one LLM call) and
    dropped from raw_turns. This bounds prompt-token growth (and therefore
    cost/latency) in long sessions instead of re-sending the entire
    transcript every turn -- a concrete, measurable trade-off discussed in
    docs/COST_LATENCY_TRADEOFFS.md.
