Structured Data Sub-Agent: natural language -> validated SQL -> rows.

Flow: build a schema-grounded prompt (schema + KPI catalog + active
conversation filters) -> ask the LLM (worker role, cheap/fast model) for a
single SELECT -> validate+execute via src/tools/sql_tool -> on a safety/
execution error, retry ONCE with the error fed back to the LLM ("Support
answer validation, retry mechanisms") -> return a structured result the
orchestrator can cite and format.

Given a user question (possibly with resolved context filters), output ONE single

KPI column reference:
{chr(10).join(f"  {k}: {v['label']} ({v['unit']})" for k, v in KPI_CATALOG.items())}

Known brands: {', '.join(ALL_BRANDS)}
Known countries: {', '.join(ALL_COUNTRIES)}
Known channels: {', '.join(ALL_CHANNELS)}

Rules:
- Only reference the tables/columns above.
- If the question implies a time comparison (YoY, QoQ, "vs last year"), compute
  it with conditional aggregation or yearly group by.
- If the question refers to the company as a whole (AB InBev), asks about overall
  performance, or does not specify a brand/country, do NOT filter by brand or country.
- When asked in which year performance was poor, worst, best, highest, lowest, or to
  compare performance across years, select yearly totals across all available years:
  SELECT year, SUM(net_revenue_usd) AS net_revenue_usd, SUM(volume) AS volume, AVG(gross_margin_pct) AS gross_margin_pct, AVG(market_share_pct) AS market_share_pct FROM fact_monthly_kpi GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
- If a brand/country/channel named by the user is not in the known lists above,
  do NOT invent a row for it -- instead select nothing for it (the caller
  handles reporting unsupported entities).
- Always GROUP BY the non-aggregated dimensions requested.
- Output raw SQL only.
